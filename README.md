Bridge Problem
This is a simple bridge problem.

4 people are on the WEST side of the bridge and need to get to the EAST side.  There is a raft that can hold 2 people on it and the flashlight must go across.  The 4 people can go across in N minutes where n is defined as Pn where P is the person.  
The 4 people are 
P1
P2
P5
P10
Your goal is to get everyone across the bridge in the least amount of time possible.
